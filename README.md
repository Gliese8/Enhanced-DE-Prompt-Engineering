# TASK 1: Revenue & Refund Report Optimization (PostgreSQL 15)

## ‚ú® Overview

This documentation describes how a nightly SQL job used to generate a report of "Yesterday's Revenue & Refunds" was analyzed and optimized using both **ChatGPT** and **Cursor AI assistant**. The initial query had grown inefficient due to feature growth and increasing data volume, taking \~70s to complete. The goal was to reduce execution time to under 15 seconds to meet Finance SLA.

---

## üìä Original Query (Before Optimization)

```sql
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.customer_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN oi.status = 'FULFILLED' THEN oi.quantity * oi.unit_price ELSE 0 END) AS gross_sales,
    COALESCE(r.total_refund, 0) AS total_refund,
    c.iso_code AS currency
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT order_id, SUM(amount) AS total_refund
    FROM refunds
    WHERE created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1
    GROUP BY order_id
) r ON r.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN currencies c ON c.currency_id = o.currency_id
WHERE o.created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1
GROUP BY o.order_id, o.customer_id, r.total_refund, c.iso_code
ORDER BY gross_sales DESC;
```

## üß™ Bottleneck Analysis by ChatGPT

| Bottleneck                              | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå Sequential scan on orders and refunds | Caused by `created_at::date = ...` disabling index use               |

## üîç Prompt Used in ChatGPT

"You're a senior data engineer. Analyze the following PostgreSQL 15 SQL query and identify performance bottlenecks like sequential scans, hash joins, late filtering, or memory spill risk. This query currently takes \~70 seconds to run due to feature growth, and Finance needs it under 15 seconds to meet SLA.

Then, suggest at least two scalable optimization strategies (not just syntax changes). Consider using early filtering with CTEs, eliminating subqueries using FILTER clauses, rewriting aggregations with GROUP BY, and indexing recommendations.

Make sure your suggestions reduce scan size, join volume, and memory pressure. Explain which changes improve which bottleneck."

## üî® Final Optimized Query (ChatGPT Suggested)

```sql
WITH filtered_orders AS (
    SELECT order_id, customer_id, currency_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - 1 AND created_at < CURRENT_DATE
),
filtered_refunds AS (
    SELECT order_id, SUM(amount) AS total_refund
    FROM refunds
    WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - 1 AND created_at < CURRENT_DATE
    GROUP BY order_id
),
order_sales AS (
    SELECT
        o.order_id,
        o.customer_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN oi.status = 'FULFILLED' THEN oi.quantity * oi.unit_price ELSE 0 END) AS gross_sales
    FROM filtered_orders o
    LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    GROUP BY o.order_id, o.customer_id
)
SELECT
    os.order_id,
    os.customer_id,
    os.gross_sales,
    COALESCE(r.total_refund, 0) AS total_refund,
    c.iso_code AS currency
FROM order_sales os
LEFT JOIN filtered_refunds r ON r.order_id = os.order_id
LEFT JOIN currencies c ON c.currency_id = os.currency_id
ORDER BY os.gross_sales DESC;
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Cursor Output (Window Function Version)

**Prompt Used:**

> Rewrite to use a single window-function to pass over `order_items` (partition by `order_id`) and JOIN that result to orders. Eliminate the refunds sub-query by turning it into a window sum on refunds with a FILTER clause. Add EXPLAIN ANALYZE before and after.

**Cursor Output (Version 1):**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
WITH order_totals AS (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'FULFILLED' THEN quantity * unit_price ELSE 0 END)
        OVER (PARTITION BY order_id) AS gross_sales
    FROM order_items
)
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.customer_id,
    ot.gross_sales,
    COALESCE(SUM(r.amount) FILTER (WHERE r.created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1)
        OVER (PARTITION BY o.order_id), 0) AS total_refund,
    c.iso_code AS currency
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_totals ot ON ot.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN refunds r ON r.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN currencies c ON c.currency_id = o.currency_id
WHERE o.created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1
ORDER BY ot.gross_sales DESC;
```

**Cursor Output (Version 2 - Based on ChatGPT prompt suggestion):**

```sql
WITH filtered_orders AS (
    SELECT order_id, customer_id, currency_id
    FROM orders 
    WHERE created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1
),
filtered_refunds AS (
    SELECT order_id, SUM(amount) AS total_refund
    FROM refunds
    WHERE created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1
    GROUP BY order_id
),
order_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        o.order_id,
        o.customer_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN oi.status = 'FULFILLED' THEN oi.quantity * oi.unit_price ELSE 0 END) AS gross_sales
    FROM filtered_orders o
    LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    GROUP BY o.order_id, o.customer_id
)
SELECT 
    os.order_id,
    os.customer_id,
    os.gross_sales,
    COALESCE(r.total_refund, 0) AS total_refund,
    c.iso_code AS currency
FROM order_sales os
LEFT JOIN filtered_refunds r ON r.order_id = os.order_id
LEFT JOIN currencies c ON c.currency_id = os.currency_id
ORDER BY os.gross_sales DESC;
```

## üß© Two Cursor Versions Compared

| Version   | Description              | Source           | Key Characteristics                                                       | Result Differences                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version 1 | Window Function + Filter | Cursor prompt    | No GROUP BY, uses `FILTER (WHERE ...) OVER`, compact but error-prone      | Potentially incorrect totals due to duplicate refund rows |
| Version 2 | CTE with GROUP BY        | ChatGPT-enhanced | Filters early, aggregates correctly with GROUP BY, matches original logic | Accurate results, accepted for final production use       |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendation

While Cursor's Version 1 aligned with the prompt, the **Version 2 (aligned with ChatGPT)** is preferred for production due to:

* Clear separation of concerns (CTEs)
* Controlled aggregation with GROUP BY
* Index-aware filtering
* Minimal risk of duplication or spill

## üîπ Suggested Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created ON orders(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_refunds_created ON refunds(order_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_fulfilled ON order_items(order_id, created_at) WHERE status = 'FULFILLED';
```

## üìä Outcome

‚úÖ SLA achieved (execution time <15s)<br>
‚úÖ Query now modular, auditable, and optimized<br>
‚úÖ Documented analysis + transformation trail using ChatGPT and Cursor

# TASK 2: Online Store Sales Analysis (SQLite)

## ‚ú® Context

We were given a dataset representing customer orders and tasked with analyzing:

* Total sales for March 2024
* Top-spending customer overall
* Average order value for the last 3 months (Jan‚ÄìMar 2024)

I used SQLite Online to run queries and considered how to structure this for repeated use.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer TEXT,
    amount REAL,
    order_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO orders (customer, amount, order_date) VALUES
('Alice', 5000, '2024-03-01'),
('Bob', 8000, '2024-03-05'),
('Alice', 3000, '2024-03-15'),
('Charlie', 7000, '2024-02-20'),
('Alice', 10000, '2024-02-28'),
('Bob', 4000, '2024-02-10'),
('Charlie', 9000, '2024-03-22'),
('Alice', 2000, '2024-03-30');
```

## üîç Queries and Results

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Sales for March 2024

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_march_sales
FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-03-01' AND '2024-03-31';
```

**‚úÖ Result:** 27000

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Top-Spending Customer

```sql
SELECT customer, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**‚úÖ Result:** Alice (20000)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Average Order Value (Last 3 Months)

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(amount), 2) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31';
```

**‚úÖ Result:** 6000.00

## üîÅ Moving Toward Reusability & Optimization

### ‚úÖ Index Recommendations

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date ON orders(order_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders(customer);
```

### ‚úÖ Views for Reusability

```sql
CREATE VIEW monthly_totals AS
SELECT 
    strftime('%Y-%m', order_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
    ROUND(SUM(amount) * 1.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders
GROUP BY month;

CREATE VIEW top_customer_overall AS
SELECT customer, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 1;

CREATE VIEW top_customer_monthly AS
SELECT month, customer, total_sales FROM (
    SELECT 
        strftime('%Y-%m', order_date) AS month,
        customer,
        SUM(amount) AS total_sales,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY strftime('%Y-%m', order_date)
            ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
        ) AS rank
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY month, customer
) WHERE rank = 1;
```

## üìà Example Queries Using Views

```sql
-- üîπ Total March Sales:
SELECT total_sales FROM monthly_totals WHERE month = '2024-03';

-- üîπ Top Spender in March:
SELECT * FROM top_customer_monthly WHERE month = '2024-03';

-- üîπ Average Order Value in March:
SELECT avg_order_value FROM monthly_totals WHERE month = '2024-03';

-- üîπ Top Spender Overall:
SELECT * FROM top_customer_overall;
```
