# TASK 1: Revenue & Refund Report Optimization (PostgreSQL 15)

## ✨ Overview

This documentation describes how a nightly SQL job used to generate a report of "Yesterday's Revenue & Refunds" was analyzed and optimized using both **ChatGPT (senior data engineer perspective)** and **Cursor AI assistant**. The initial query had grown inefficient due to feature growth and increasing data volume, taking \~70s to complete. The goal was to reduce execution time to **under 15 seconds** to meet Finance SLA.

## 📊 Original Query (Before Optimization)

```sql
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.customer_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN oi.status = 'FULFILLED' THEN oi.quantity * oi.unit_price ELSE 0 END) AS gross_sales,
    COALESCE(r.total_refund, 0) AS total_refund,
    c.iso_code AS currency
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT order_id, SUM(amount) AS total_refund
    FROM refunds
    WHERE created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1
    GROUP BY order_id
) r ON r.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN currencies c ON c.currency_id = o.currency_id
WHERE o.created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1
GROUP BY o.order_id, o.customer_id, r.total_refund, c.iso_code
ORDER BY gross_sales DESC;
```

## 🧪 Bottleneck Analysis (Senior Data Engineer View)

| Bottleneck                                  | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Sequential scan on `orders` and `refunds` | Caused by `created_at::date = ...` disabling index use               |
| ❌ Hash joins on large tables                | Joins with `order_items`, `refunds`, and `currencies` are unfiltered |
| ❌ Memory pressure                           | Aggregations over large unfiltered joins can spill to disk           |
| ❌ Refunds subquery                          | Requires separate pass, not reused                                   |
| ⚠️ Late filtering of `order_items`          | `status = 'FULFILLED'` applied inside `CASE` instead of WHERE        |
| ⚠️ No indexing guidance                     | Indexes missing on critical filter columns                           |

## 🔍 Prompt Used in ChatGPT for Full Optimization

```plaintext
You're a senior data engineer. Analyze the following PostgreSQL 15 SQL query and identify performance bottlenecks like sequential scans, hash joins, late filtering, or memory spill risk. This query currently takes ~70 seconds to run due to feature growth, and Finance needs it under 15 seconds to meet SLA.

Then, suggest at least two scalable optimization strategies (not just syntax changes). Consider using early filtering with CTEs, eliminating subqueries using FILTER clauses, rewriting aggregations with GROUP BY, and indexing recommendations.

Make sure your suggestions reduce scan size, join volume, and memory pressure. Explain which changes improve which bottleneck.
```

## 🔨 Final Optimized Query (ChatGPT Suggested and Accepted)

```sql
WITH filtered_orders AS (
    SELECT order_id, customer_id, currency_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - 1 AND created_at < CURRENT_DATE
),
filtered_refunds AS (
    SELECT order_id, SUM(amount) AS total_refund
    FROM refunds
    WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - 1 AND created_at < CURRENT_DATE
    GROUP BY order_id
),
order_sales AS (
    SELECT
        o.order_id,
        o.customer_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN oi.status = 'FULFILLED' THEN oi.quantity * oi.unit_price ELSE 0 END) AS gross_sales
    FROM filtered_orders o
    LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    GROUP BY o.order_id, o.customer_id
)
SELECT
    os.order_id,
    os.customer_id,
    os.gross_sales,
    COALESCE(r.total_refund, 0) AS total_refund,
    c.iso_code AS currency
FROM order_sales os
LEFT JOIN filtered_refunds r ON r.order_id = os.order_id
LEFT JOIN currencies c ON c.currency_id = os.currency_id
ORDER BY os.gross_sales DESC;
```

## ⚖️ Cursor Output (Window Function Version)

### Prompt Used:

```plaintext
Rewrite to use a single window-function to pass over order_items (partition by order_id) and JOIN that result to orders. Eliminate the refunds sub-query by turning it into a window sum on refunds with a FILTER clause. Add EXPLAIN ANALYZE before and after.
```

### Output:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
WITH order_totals AS (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'FULFILLED' THEN quantity * unit_price ELSE 0 END) OVER (PARTITION BY order_id) AS gross_sales
    FROM order_items
)
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.customer_id,
    ot.gross_sales,
    COALESCE(SUM(r.amount) FILTER (WHERE r.created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1) OVER (PARTITION BY o.order_id), 0) AS total_refund,
    c.iso_code AS currency
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_totals ot ON ot.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN refunds r ON r.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN currencies c ON c.currency_id = o.currency_id
WHERE o.created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1
ORDER BY ot.gross_sales DESC;
```

### Cursor Output Review:

| Aspect                      | Status | Comment                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Window Function Used        | ✅      | As prompted                                            |
| Refund Subquery Removed     | ✅      | Replaced with FILTER clause                            |
| Index-Friendly Filtering    | ❌      | Still uses `::date` casting                            |
| Row Deduplication           | ❌      | No GROUP BY or DISTINCT to prevent duplicates          |
| Refund Aggregation Accuracy | ❌      | At risk of overcounting due to join with windowed rows |

---

## ✅ Final Recommendation

While Cursor's version aligned with the prompt, the **ChatGPT version is preferred for production** due to:

* Clear separation of concerns (CTEs)
* Controlled aggregation with `GROUP BY`
* Index-aware filtering
* Minimal risk of duplication or spill

---

## 🔹 Suggested Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created ON orders(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_refunds_created ON refunds(order_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_fulfilled ON order_items(order_id, created_at) WHERE status = 'FULFILLED';
```

---

## 📊 Outcome

* ✅ SLA achieved (execution time <15s)
* ✅ Query now modular, auditable, and optimized
* ✅ Documented analysis + transformation trail using ChatGPT and Cursor

---

## 📄 Maintainer Notes

* Consider converting CTEs into materialized views if future performance issues arise
* Monitor query plan stability using `pg_stat_statements`
* Consider snapshotting daily metrics into an intermediate reporting table
